What is the difference between basic auth and digest auth?
Digest authentication is another authentication type specified in HTTP 1.1. 
Unlike basic authentication, digest authentication does not require the password to be transmitted. 
Rather, the client takes the username and password and uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to create a hash, which is then sent to the SQL Server.
